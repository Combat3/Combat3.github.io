# Combat3.github.io
Combat 3 website revived by z0mbieslayer! https://github.com/z0mbieslayer

Worklog

Build 1: Only a few links on the site work currently (The play button is one of them and you should be able to play the game).

Build 2: Fixed database error on Combat 3, game should be functional now except for a few features I don't have control over. I also added a members tab that needs some work on the style side of it. Other than that, the site is working great! You may also notice the main page to the website doesn't look like the Play Game page. I am currently working on fixing this issue and I will release the next build when it is fixed.
