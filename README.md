# Combat3.github.io
Combat 3 website revived by z0mbieslayer! https://github.com/z0mbieslayer

Worklog

Build 1: Very basic functions, only fully working page is "Play Now"

Build 2: Fixed Database Error on Combat 3 and Multiplayer now works. Most links on all pages redirect to wayback machine as I have not implemented them yet.

Build 3: This is the biggest build yet; What I've added is a mostly working Map Contest tab, however only the December 13th contest is implemented. I have also fixed most if not all pages (In terms of GUI). And finally, the Headlines bar is now functional!
