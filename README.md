# Combat3.github.io
Combat 3 website revived by z0mbieslayer! https://github.com/z0mbieslayer

Worklog

Build 1: Only a few links on the site work currently (The play button is one of them and you should be able to play the game).

Build 2: Fixed database error on Combat 3, game should be functional now except for a few features I don't have control over. You may also notice the main page to the website doesn't look like the Play Game page. I am currently working on fixing this issue and I will release the next build when it is fixed.
